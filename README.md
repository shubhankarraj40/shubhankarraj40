<h1> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1> <br/> 
I am currently a second-year undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at SRM University. As a passionate learner, I am always eager to explore new technology. I like coding where I am more into C and C++, I am a beginner and currently learning the concepts of question-solving.
In my free time, I like playing Cricket and other games.
